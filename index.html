    <!-- <h1>Namaste Everyone!  </h1> 
                    below we are getting same thing using JAVASCRIPT in <script> .....</script>
                         Suppose this <h1>Namaste Everyone!  </h1>  is not defined  inside <body>.....</body> tag 
                                   then with help of JS we can embed <h1>Namaste Everyone!  </h1>  inside body tag as can be seen inside script tag below -->
    <script>

              ?how do i put above created h1 tag element/node inside root?
                   1. pickup id="root" element by .getElementById("root") inside which we wil be adding h1 tag element 
                       2. now use appendChild(heading) which  here it is "heading" element to be appended inside "root" element.

       *? How does browser run this code ?
       *? How doew browser get to know what is document, createElement , innerHTML ?
       
       * ANS: Browser get to know through browser API
                      as browser has a <JS engine> which gave all this functionality (window,document)
                                         thats why browser knows what is window, document  and all its method etc.
